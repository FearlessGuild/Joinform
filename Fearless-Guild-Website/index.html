     <h3>Welcome to Fearless ‚Äî where legends rise, and fear falls</h3>
     <br>
      <p><strong>Fearless</strong> is not just a name ‚Äî it's a statement. We are a community of bold, skilled, and passionate Free Fire players who believe in pushing limits and rising above fear. Formed with the vision to unite warriors under one banner, Fearless brings together fighters from all backgrounds, bonded by a common goal: to dominate the battlefield with courage and unity.Our guild thrives on teamwork, discipline, and high-energy gameplay. Every match is a new challenge, and every member is trained to adapt, survive, and conquer. We believe that true strength lies in collaboration, not chaos. That‚Äôs why we prioritize communication, strategy, and support ‚Äî both in and out of combat.</p>
      <br>
      <p><strong>Fearless</strong>is more than a competitive squad; it's a brotherhood and sisterhood. Whether you're grinding in ranked matches, pushing your K/D ratio, or training to master every weapon, this is a place where your efforts are recognized and your skills are sharpened. Our senior members help guide newer players, and together we grow stronger with every fight.

We respect the game, respect our teammates, and play with honor. Toxicity has no place here. We celebrate wins, learn from defeats, and always rise again ‚Äî stronger than before. In Fearless, your only limit is how far you‚Äôre willing to go.</p>
     <br>
     <p>So if you have the fire, the focus, and the fearlessness to rise with us ‚Äî welcome to the family. üèÜ</p>

    <div class="section-title">History of Fearless</div>
    <p><strong>FEARLESS</strong> was born on <strong>20/12/2020</strong>, started by <strong>Tholz</strong>, who was just 15 years old then ‚Äî a young dreamer with a fearless heart. The guild began under the name <em>‚ÄúI Am Waiting‚Äù</em>, bringing together a small squad of passionate players.</p>
    <p>As the days turned to years, our spirit only grew stronger. Now at 20, Tholz (aka <strong>FL God</strong>) leads us into battles with the same fire, turning a teenage dream into a powerful legacy. Today, FEARLESS stands as a family that continues to grow, inspire, and dominate every match we play.</p>
    <p><em>One of the best revenge guilds in Free Fire.</em></p>
